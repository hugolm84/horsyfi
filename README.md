![horse](https://github.com/hugolm84/horsyfi/blob/master/horsify/img/main-horse.jpeg "Horsis")
## ===Short version desc ===
Travel Iceland by horse based on now playing track. 

## ===Creators===
Hugo Lindström, Thanks to Sebastian Helms for animations and such!
Thanks to the spotify kitchensink that help me get in to apps api!

## ===About the Hack===
I'v always wanted to travel Iceland by horse, so why not make a application that takes you around Iceland by awesome horses? 
Now you can explore Iceland by different horse types. Maybe you'd like to travel the Golden Circle by Gangsta Horse, and just completely ignore all attractions because of coolness factor.  Or maybe you are a city horse, and just stroll around in your trusk innercity style!? 

Just add the app to Spotify Apps and drop a playlist...
#### Also works with any now playing track, like radio
 
## === Technology used===
Im using Spotify Apps API, Google Maps API and Echonest. Im trying to do some silly mixup based on genre, tempo and danceabillity. Only one route works but if more time was given, it could be applied to Google Maps route. 

It doesnt show you any info about attractions on the way, but will tell you if you missed it. Future thoughts would be to smooth the transition and disable marker clicks if you missed the spot.
